# v2ray Scraper

This Python script connects to multiple Telegram channels and extracts proxy configurations from recent messages, including **V2Ray** and **MTProto** links.

---

## üöÄ Installation

First, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install telethon
# optional (for clipboard support)
pip install pyperclip
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The configuration file is channels.json.

- It contains:

    - A list of Telegram channels.

    - api_id and api_hash (needed for Telegram API authentication).

    - For each channel, you can specify how many recent messages to fetch.

By default, the script uses Telegram Desktop API keys, so you can run it without changes.
However, you may replace them with your own api_id and api_hash if needed.
