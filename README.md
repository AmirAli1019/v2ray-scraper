# v2ray Scraper

This Python script connects to multiple Telegram channels and extracts proxy configurations from recent messages, including **V2Ray** and **MTProto** links.

---

## üöÄ Installation

Fisrt, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmirAli104/v2ray-scraper
```

Or as a better option download the lastest release from the [releases](https://github.com/AmirAli104/v2ray-scraper/releases) page.

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install telethon

# optional (for clipboard support)
pip install pyperclip

# optional (for proxy support)
pip install pysocks
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python src/v2ray-scraper.py [options]
```

After you run the program for the first time. It asks you for your telegram account phone number and other login requirements.
Actually it uses your telegram account to access channels so you can add a private channel to `channels.json` file. Edit this file according to the configuration guide below.

For scraping data from private channels ensure that you have joined them in telegram.

**Warning: After logging in, a file with the extension `.session` will be created. this is the key to access your telegram account so you don't need to login every time you run the program, but notice that you must keep the `.session` file in a safe place to prevent others to access your telegram account**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The configuration file is channels.json.

- It contains:

    - A list of Telegram channels.

    - api_id and api_hash (needed for Telegram API authentication).

    - For each channel, you can specify how many recent messages to fetch.

By default, the script uses Telegram Desktop API keys, so you can run it without changes.
However, you may replace them with your own api_id and api_hash if needed.

## Termux Support

You can use `v2ray-scraper` on android using Termux. First download it from [f-droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/).
Then clone the repo and install python3:

```bash
pkg install git python3
git clone https://github.com/amirali104/v2ray-scraper
```

Next, install `telethon`:

```bash
pip install telethon

# optional (for proxy support)
pip install pysocks
```

But if you want clipboard support you cannot use `pyperclip` for that. Instead install [Termux:API](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux.api/) from F-Droid and the package `termux-api` on termux:

```bash
pkg install termux-api
```

Then you can run it on your mobile in the same way you run it on your computer.

## üìã Example

```bash
# Extract V2Ray proxies, copy them to clipboard, and print to console
python src/v2ray-scraper.py -v -c -p
```
